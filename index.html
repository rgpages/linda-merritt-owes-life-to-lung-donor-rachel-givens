			<p class="bat_dropcap">In the weeks after her daughter’s death, Laura Givens sat at her computer and typed a letter to someone she’d never met.</p>
			<p>Givens sent seven copies — one for her daughter’s heart, one for her liver, one for her lungs and one for each of her kidneys and eyes. She sent them anonymously, seeded with clues leading back to the girl with raven-black hair and four sacred Navajo mountains tattooed on her shoulder.</p>
			<i>
				<p>“Our daughter was 23 years old when she passed away so unexpectedly. We miss her greatly but await the day we will be reunified with her.</p>

			<i>
				<p>Her favorite number was #32. She loved the color blue. She had seven tattoos that represented her many glorious aspects.”</p>
			</i>
			<p>One of those tattoos was her mother’s signature — Laura’s signature — and that number, 32. That was the number Rachel Givens had worn on the basketball court, where she was known for her outside shooting.</p>
			<i>
				<p>“The best 3 point shooter and goalie ever,” Laura wrote.</p>
			</i>
			<p>Laura and Rachel were best friends, though Laura never allowed herself to say it. Not to Rachel, at least, because that would have been weird — a blurring of the lines between mother and daughter, she thought.</p>
			<p>Now that Rachel was gone, Laura clung to the knowledge that a part of her lived on in someone else. She sent the letters because she wanted those people to know Rachel, and because she hoped that someone would read her story and respond.</p>
			<i>
			<p>“This is just a snapshot of our Daughter’s amazing world. We wish you all a healthy and peaceful life, and we hope to someday meet some of you if that is appropriate, to fill you in on more details if you wish.</p>
			<p>God Bless and Thank You!”</p>

			<p class="bat_dropcap">Hands on her hips, Linda Merritt sucked air into her lungs as she walked the gravel driveway leading to the Homestead RV Park near Creswell.</p>
			<p>She and her partner, Leland Hilarides, had just finished their morning exercise routine, jogging and walking between telephone poles along the half-mile stretch of blacktop leading to the highway.</p>

			<p>Grimacing as she walked, Linda felt her 47-year-old body rebelling against her 23-year-old lungs. Before the transplant, she never would have called herself an athlete. The best way to make her run, she joked, is to tie a dog treat to her ankles and release the hounds.</p>
			<p>Leland, Linda’s companion of six years, concurred.</p>
			<p>“This is no Serena Williams over here,” he said, referring to the tennis superstar.</p>
			<p>“Thanks, babe.”</p>
			<p>Linda and Leland share a mobile home at Homestead Park and an acerbic sense of humor. She was a flagger on road construction crews. He has a ponytail and sings in classic rock bands, names of which include Monolith, Mr. Wizard and IDM (short for “It Don’t Matter”).</p>

		<div class="bat_story">
			<p>The two got together for good in 2009 after Linda wandered into a bar and heard Leland singing from the stage.</p>
			<p>“Leland,” she said, “has the voice of an angel.”</p>
			<p>The two aren’t married, but close enough. (“He gave me a Harley, so we’re kind of hitched,” Linda says.) They’ve been friends since high school, giving them the easy banter of a couple who can finish each other’s sentences.</p>
			<p>Here’s how they describe the day a doctor came to tell Linda she was dying, only to find the two of them laughing.</p>
			<p>“Leland and I, it’s like everything is always funny,” Linda said. “We find humor in the ...</p>
			<p>He interjected: “... darkest places.”</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p class="bat_dropcap">This was a dark place, all right. As she progressed through her 40s, Linda had noticed herself gasping for breath, getting winded even after the slightest exertion. She attributed it to smoking and being out of shape, but after checking into the hospital with pneumonia in 2012, she learned it was something more serious.</p>
			<p>Doctors performed a biopsy to examine her lungs and returned with the diagnosis of UIP, usual interstitial pneumonia. It sounded innocuous enough, but as Leland and Linda researched, they realized it was linked to several deadly lung diseases.</p>
			<p>“I went through one day where it was like, ‘Yes! No lung cancer!’ ” Linda said. “Then the next day it was like, ‘Oh, it’s worse.’ ”</p>
			<p>Linda and Leland prepared for something bad, which explains why they could smile when the doctor delivered the news: pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension and emphysema, a triple whammy of lung disease.</p>
			<p>Beneath the laughter was a feeling of denial. Linda took the tests and read the literature, but after a year of waiting, it took a stern warning from one of her doctors to drive home the urgency of her situation.</p>

		<div class="bat_story">
			<p>Linda’s lung capacity was 13 percent and fading. Without a transplant, her prognosis was grim.</p>
			<p>“There’s no way she would be here,” Leland said.</p>
			<p>Linda nodded: “I’d be dead.”</p>
			<p>Leland and Linda tried to stay upbeat as they planned the next steps, which included relocating to Seattle and moving into the Transplant House, an apartment complex for patients awaiting transplants at the University of Washington Medical Center.</p>
			<p>As Linda’s caregiver, Leland felt a duty to convey no sense of panic. Occasionally, in private moments, the facade would crack.</p>
			<p>“I’d be in taking a shower, and all of a sudden the reality of what was going on would hit me,” he said. “I’d just cry like a little baby.</p>
			<p>“Once in a while, it kicks you right in the ass that, wow, this is scary business.”</p>
			<p>The dark humor comes back as Leland describes the process of performing a lung transplant, which involves a long horizontal incision just above the patient’s abdomen.</p>
			<p>“I swear to God, they cut it here and flip it open like a car hood,” he said, running a finger across his black T-shirt. “Did you know you have a little light inside there when you flip the hood up?”</p>
			<p>For 85 days, Linda carried a beat-up cellphone everywhere she went, waiting for the call that told her a donor had been found.</p>
			<p>As they watched the evening news one night, they saw a story about a young woman killed in a hit-and-run near Tacoma. Neither thought much of it, except to shake their heads at the tragedy — a girl, 23 years old, killed as she crossed the street to join her friends at a neighborhood pub.</p>
			<p>Three days later, the cellphone rang.</p>

		<div class="bat_story">
			<p>Rachel was born in Oklahoma, but she spent much of her life in Washington and shared a common Navajo heritage with members of the Muckleshoot community. She attended the public school, Auburn Riverside High, where she was a goalkeeper on the soccer team and a sharpshooter on two state-championship basketball teams.</p>
			<p>“She’s definitely not the most serious kid in the world,” her soccer coach, Paul Lewis, told The Seattle Times. “She’s tough, but she’s definitely one of the jokers of the group.”</p>
			<p>On the night of Oct. 5, 2013, Rachel was meeting friends at the Log Cabin Pub and Eatery, one of her familiar hangouts. Just before 11 p.m., she and two friends parked their car and started walking across East Valley Highway, where traffic was light at that time of night.</p>
			<p>Ten minutes later, Laura’s phone rang.</p>
			<p>“I got a call from one of her friends saying she got hit,” Laura said. “I was thinking, ‘Oh, she got into a fight? Or the car got into an accident?’</p>
			<p>“Never in my wildest dreams would I think she got hit walking across that road. Never.”</p>
			<p>Laura rushed to the scene and found paramedics attending to Rachel on the street. The sight flipped a switch inside of Laura; she was a coach now, shouting instructions as her daughter bled on the pavement.</p>
		</div><!-- /.bat_story -->
		<div class="bat_quote">
			<h4>“You’re not going to die right here! You’re not dying here. Not today, Rachel Givens!”</h4>
			<p>- Laura Givens remembers shouting</p>
		</div>
		<div class="bat_story">
			<!-- <p>“You’re not going to die right here!” she remembers shouting. “You’re not dying here. Not today, Rachel Givens!” </p> -->
			<p>Thinking back on that night, Laura understands the source of her instinct. Rachel had chosen to become an organ donor, a choice signified by a little red heart on her driver’s license. To fulfill those wishes, she needed to be alive when she reached the hospital.</p>
			<p>Doctors declared Rachel brain dead two days after the accident. By then, Laura knew she wasn’t coming back.</p>
			<p>“For me, Rachel was already gone,” Laura said. </p>
			<p>Police didn’t find the driver of the dark sedan that struck Rachel. Though the investigation remains open, they say they have no leads.</p>
			<p>After the accident, Laura used a phone-finder app to track Rachel’s iPhone, expecting to find it in a field beside the highway.</p>
			<p>The app pinged an address she didn’t recognize in Sumner. Laura wanted police to pursue the lead, thinking the phone might be lodged in the grill of the car that killed her daughter. </p>
			<p>Nothing materialized. Laura has tried to move on.</p>
			<p>“We pray for that person as well,” she said. “It’s done. There’s nothing that could bring her back.”</p>
			<p>When you lose a child, Laura said, the pain never recedes. Somehow, the idea that Rachel’s death brought life to someone else made the universe seem a little less empty without her.</p>
			<p>That’s why Laura decided to reach out to the seven organ recipients. She wanted them to know it was OK, that they shouldn’t feel guilty for accepting Rachel’s gift.</p>
			<p>Laura sealed the letters and sent them off through LifeCenter Northwest, the organization that coordinated Rachel’s organ donations.</p>
			<p>Six months later, someone wrote back.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p class="bat_dropcap">For weeks after she received the letter, Linda wrestled with how to respond.</p>
			<p>How could she explain the miracle of the transplant — how she came home three months later, new lungs pulsing in her chest? How could she say thank you for something so profound?</p>
			<p>At one of her support group meetings, Linda explained her dilemma to a donor mom who had lost a daughter. She wanted to write back, she explained, but couldn’t find the right words.</p>
			<p>“I’ve started so many times,” Linda said. “How do you thank somebody for your life?”</p>
			<p>“You don’t have to write it all,” the woman told her. “It doesn’t have to be perfect, Linda. It just has to be something.”</p>
			<p>At 4 a.m. the next day, Linda sat up in bed, grabbed her phone and began to write, tapping out her message in an email.</p>
			<i>
				<p>“I received your daughter’s lungs, and because of that, I wake up each day in wonder, looking forward to whatever new adventure comes my way, excited and happy that I can take a deep breath ...</p>
				<p>I cannot ever express how much sorrow and empathy I feel for your horrible loss, but I want you to know that your daughter lives on in me. Thank you for the greatest gift I’ll ever receive, and even though I don’t know you ... I love you.”</p>
			</i>
			<p>By this time, Linda wasn’t writing to a stranger. After reading the description of Rachel, Linda’s pulmonologist found Laura’s Facebook page, which Laura had made public in hopes of connecting with one of Rachel’s organ recipients.</p>

		<div class="bat_story">
			<p>Linda resisted at first, but her curiosity won out. Looking at the Facebook page, she learned that Rachel was a star athlete and a member of the Navajo community. Organ donation is taboo in the Navajo culture, she learned, and Rachel’s decision had required courage.</p>
			<p>Linda had these thoughts on her mind as she composed her letter to Laura. She sent it back through the LifeCenter caseworker, hoping it would lead to further contact with Rachel’s family.</p>
			<p>On Christmas morning in 2014, Linda opened her computer and found an email with Laura’s phone number. Standard etiquette is for the donor family to initiate contact, but Linda saw the number and couldn’t wait.</p>
			<p>“I couldn’t think of a better day to call and thank somebody for my life,” she said.</p>
			<p>Laura had been hoping for this call since she sent those seven letters. The recipient of Rachel’s liver wrote back once, but they’ve had no further contact. Laura doesn’t know the others.</p>
			<p>There is only Linda, a surrogate carrying the last living parts of Rachel through the world.</p>
			<p>“Every single day, the heartache, the crying ... it’s still there,” Laura said. “But having Linda in my life is amazing. You feel a little better. You have a little bounce in your step, saying, ‘Yeah, that’s my daughter’s gift she gave.’ ”</p>

			<p>Laura and Linda have become closer than either could have predicted. They talk regularly, and when Linda decided to run her first 5K — the Silvan Ridge Twilight race in August — the entire Givens family showed up, just as they did for Rachel’s basketball games.</p>
			<p>As she crossed the finish line, lungs heaving, Linda felt Laura’s arms wrap around her.</p>
			<p>“It was like a proof of life,” Laura said. “People tell you, ‘So-and-so gave their lungs,’ but it’s not real. Seeing Linda, hugging her, feeling her breathe on my neck when we hugged — I can’t even put it into words.</p>
			<p>“Linda is living proof that my daughter was here.”</p>
